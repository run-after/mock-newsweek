This is a part of The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/using-bootstrap)

In this assignment, I practiced using Bootstrap by recreatinng the Newsweek website (https://newsweek.com).

I didn't focus too hard on getting everything to flow in the correct order. I mostly just explored using Bootstrap to make the layout responsive.

This was a challenging project for me. I have found that I prefer to roll my own CSS.
